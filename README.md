### ðŸ¤– Michael Craig

**'Life-Long Creator & Innovator'**

I believe that my life's purpose is to help and impact as many people as possible in my lifetime using my technical abilities in Programming & Engineering. I believe in big picture thinking; Creating innovative systems and using them in the right ways can help push humanity into a brighter future. I'm eager to document my progress throughout my career and teach others how I'm learning about technology via Social Media.
